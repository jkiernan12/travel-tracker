## Introduction

This app simulates a travel agencies database, and let users view past and future vacations, and lets users request new vacations. It also provides a very rudimentary dashboard for an agent to access information about current and upcoming trips and income. 

Beyond the challenge of building out all the functionality of a travel planning app, this project required us to understand API calls with Fetch, OOP with Javascript classes, import/export syntax, TDD with Mocha and Chai and packaging/bundling with NPM and Webpack. 

The rubric and project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html).

## Installation
1. Clone down this repo.
2. Within the clone directory, run `npm install` to download dependencies and `npm start` to run program.
3. Clone down the [server repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api).
4. Within the server directory, run `npm install` and `npm start`.
5. In your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
6. Login with a username of traveler + any integer up to 50 (ie `traveler23` or `traveler49`) and `travel` as a password.

Now try to commit something and push it up to your new repo. If everything is setup correctly, you should see the changes on GitHub.

## Technologies
- HTML
- Sass
- JS
- ESlint
- Mocha/Chai
- WAVE and Google Lighthouse (accessibility testing)
- NPM and Webpack (package management and bundling)

## Reflections

#### Wins
- Completing iteration 3 and beginning iteration 4
- Maintaining relatively DRY and SRP functions
- Having 100 accessibility on Lighthouse
- Responsive design
- Maintaining modular codebase

#### Challenges
This was definitely the largest scale project that we've completely solo -- and it was overwhelming at times tackling every piece of it. I had hoped I would have time to refine certain pieces of the project (testing, the agent dashboard, modular Sass files), but I ran out of time in the end. Despite the breadth and scope of the project, it was an enormous learning experience. I definitely came out of it with a better understanding of modular OOP Javascript, API calls, and accessibility.

### Future Iterations
There were a number of pieces that I would have liked to built out, enhanced or added.
- More robust testing suites with sad path testing.
- Polished and complete Agent dashboard.
- Modular Sass, and refined page styling
- Integrating other NPM packages
